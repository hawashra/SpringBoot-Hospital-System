### SpringBoot Hospital Appointments Management

Built a backend application for managing hospital operations with a focus on clean architecture, API design, and database integration.

- Developed RESTful APIs for managing patients, doctors, appointments, etc., using Spring Boot

- Used Spring Data JPA with JPASpecificationExecutor and CriteriaBuilder for advanced dynamic filtering

- Applied DTOs to decouple entities from API payloads and ensure clean API responses

- Handled errors gracefully via @RestControllerAdvice and custom exception classes

- Integrated with PostgreSQL running in a Docker container

- Tested endpoints using Postman and manual SQL queries for data verification
